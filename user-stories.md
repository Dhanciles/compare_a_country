-ideal user: a student researching about countries

1. As a user, in order to get information about a specific country, when I type in a country name and press submit, I should observe the statistics of that country displayed on the page.

2. As a user, in order to compare different countries, I should be able to see where a country lies in terms of rank globally for their population, GDP, and area (maybe more statistics).

3. I should be able to search by specific statistic and filter through for each one based on the numbers that I input.

4. There should be a separate input that I can search multiple countries to have them live on the page and compare them. 

5. As a user I should be able to star a country and have it saved to local storage. I should be able to view my starred countries on page reload. I should be able to unstar my favorite countries so they don't persist on page reload.
